## How to Install

1. Check if you have the latest version of Python and pip installed in your computer.

2. In case you haven't installed Python or is not up to date, download and install the latest version of Python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

3. Also, Linux users can install latest version of python by writing in their terminal ```sudo apt install python3.X``` (being X the latest version).

4. To install pip, you only need to ```python -m pip install --upgrade pip``` or ```sudo apt install python3-pip``` depending on your Operating System.

5. After installation is completed, ```git clone``` this repository.

6. Then, all you have to do to init the software is to ```python main.py```, ```python3 main.py``` or ```pip3 main.py```. If you followed step 3 then ```python3 main.py``` should work for you.
